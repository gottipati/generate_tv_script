# Project: TV script generation using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project Overview
Developed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network using tensorflow back end to generate our own tv script based on the past tv series data.
- Technologies used : Python, Numpy, Tensorflow, AWS

## Sample tv script
The sentences 0 to 10:
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
Bart_Simpson: Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Hold on, I'll check. (TO BARFLIES) Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick.
Moe_Szyslak: What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer_Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.
Moe_Szyslak: Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems.
Barney_Gumble: Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills.

moe_szyslak:(shocked) get out up!
moe_szyslak: and stay out!
