# Project: TV script generation using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks

## Project Overview
Developed a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network using tensorflow back end to generate our own tv script based on the past tv series data.
- Technologies used : Python, Numpy, Tensorflow, AWS

## Sample tv script
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink. <br />  
Bart_Simpson: Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch. <br />
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Hold on, I'll check. (TO BARFLIES) Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately? <br /> 
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick. <br /> 
Moe_Szyslak: What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self. <br />  
Homer_Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one. <br /> 
Moe_Szyslak: Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems. <br /> 
Barney_Gumble: Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills. <br />

moe_szyslak: missed! <br />
moe_szyslak: hey, homer. have must be a real me? <br />
homer_simpson: sweet duff. <br />
moe_szyslak:(shocked) get out up! <br />
moe_szyslak: and stay out! <br />
moe_szyslak: get out and take your sacajawea? <br />
moe_szyslak:(slightly confused) uh... <br />
homer_simpson: i was just tellin' all that says in my dank, i'm a theatrical agent, and i want to keep your femininity. <br />
marge_simpson:(fierce) oh, homer stop, you didn't write any of you. <br />
moe_szyslak: read? oh no, where's your last date with a whatchacallit, uh, hope it's twins! <br />
homer_simpson: oh, you're thinking more like homer simpson. uh, s'cuse me. <br />
moe_szyslak: twenty-five?(laughs) whoa! oh! it's me just you, play. i'm here at the bar, you could discriminate against his family, huh? <br />
moe_szyslak:(considering) well, that broad is some dame! <br />
ned_flanders:(surprised) you all know edna? <br />
barney_gumble: it was one of <br />
